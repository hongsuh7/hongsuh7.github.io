# About page

My name is Hong Suh. I'm a UC Berkeley math PhD student on leave. The peak of the breadth of my mathematical knowledge was reached a few seconds after my qualifying exam, whose transcript you can read [here](/assets/QE_transcript_hong_suh.pdf). I was a math teach at [Proof School](http://www.proofschool.org) during the academic year 2019-2020.
