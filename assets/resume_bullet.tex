\section{SELECT PROJECTS}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\square$] {\bf Neural network model for image classification and generation.} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a new neural network architecture for image classification and generation, modifying the methodology in recent normalizing flow papers.
    %\item Reduced computational cost for image generation using Neural ODEs by {\bf \textcolor{red}{x percent}} \textcolor{red}{while maintaining quality}.%Reduce computational cost of Neural ODEs, a neural network model, which are the legacy best in-class models for image generation. 
    %\item Created an interactive application to visualize the image generation process.%{\it Results.} Neural ODEs (NODEs) are the legacy best normalizing flow models for image generation, but they require high computational cost. I developed a new type of neural network inspired by NODEs that lowered computational cost by {\bf \textcolor{red}{x percent}} and can be used as a replacement for NODEs in image generation.

    \item {\it Technologies.} Pytorch, CUDA, R.

  %Neural ODEs (NODEs) are the legacy best-in-class flow models for image generation, but they require high computational cost. I developed a new type of neural network inspired by NODEs that lowered computational cost by \textcolor{red}{x percent} and can be used as a replacement for NODEs in image generation. This research is in progress.%Developed a new type of neural network which interpolates between residual networks and neural ODEs. Conducted statistical experiments to test the robustness of my network against various types of adversarial attacks compared to that of residual networks and neural ODEs. 
  \item[$\square$] {\bf Tennis win prediction model.} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Eliminated the need for human supervision by automating hyperparameter selection. 
    \item Decreased log-loss error by about 1.5\% compared to FiveThirtyEight's model.
    %\item {\it Results.} Historically, hyperparameters have been hand-picked in Elo rating systems. Taking advantage of parallelization, I developed a tennis-specific model which automates hyperparameter selection. This model decreased log-loss error by about 1.5\% compared to FiveThirtyEight's model.
    \item {\it Technologies.} Python.

  % in two main ways: by incorporating surface and by eliminating the need to set hyperparameters by hand.
  % start with verbs
  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item Current methods to take court surface into account are ad-hoc or complex. We simplified the integration of court surface into the model.
  %  \item In Elo rating systems, hyperparameters have historically been hand-picked for good reason: there is no effective method to optimize for hyperparameters. We demonstrated that in a random initial set of hyperparameters, a large proportion of them perform comparably to or better than current hand-picked hyperparameters. Taking advantage of parallelization, we were able to test a massive number of hyperparameters at once, which is a new and effective idea in Elo rating systems.

  \item[$\square$] {\bf Stochastic homogenization for an exclusion process.} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Established new quantitative bounds on the long-term statistics of a stochastic growth model, which can model infection disease growth, forest fires, crystal growth, and more. 
    %\item \textcolor{red}{\it Results.} 
  \end{itemize}
  %Infection disease growth, forest fires, and crystal growth can all be modeled with stochastic growth models. I established new quantitative bounds on the long-term statistics of a stochastic growth model. 
  %I studied long-term behavior of a stochastic growth model which can be used to model crystal growth, forest fires, infectious disease growth and more. I established new quantitative bounds on the model statistics. 
  \item[$\square$] {\bf Fringe pairs in generalized MSTD sets.} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed new algorithm to construct generalized MSTD sets, which are special finite sets of integers. 
    \item Discovered the most ``extreme'' MSTD set known at the time using the algorithm.
    %\item \textcolor{red}{\it Results.} 
    \item {\it Technologies.} Mathematica.
  \end{itemize}
  %I led a project in a team of three to find new ways to construct generalized MSTD sets, which are special finite sets of integers, and found the most ``extreme'' MSTD set known at the time using our new methods.
