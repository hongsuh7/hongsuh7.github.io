See portfolio at \url{hongsuh7.github.io} for more information on each project.
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Robustness of Neural ODEs.} Conducted statistical experiments to test the robustness of neural ODEs against various types of adversarial attacks compared to that of regular residual neural networks.
  \item {\it Predictive model run on tennis players.} Generalized an Elo rating system for tennis players. Decreased log-loss error by about 1.5\% from FiveThirtyEight's model and eliminated the need to set hyperparameters manually. %%%automating hyperparameter selection. 
  % in two main ways: by incorporating surface and by eliminating the need to set hyperparameters by hand.
  % start with verbs
  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item Current methods to take court surface into account are ad-hoc or complex. We simplified the integration of court surface into the model.
  %  \item In Elo rating systems, hyperparameters have historically been hand-picked for good reason: there is no effective method to optimize for hyperparameters. We demonstrated that in a random initial set of hyperparameters, a large proportion of them perform comparably to or better than current hand-picked hyperparameters. Taking advantage of parallelization, we were able to test a massive number of hyperparameters at once, which is a new and effective idea in Elo rating systems.

  % objective, method, and results
  \item {\it Stochastic homogenization for an exclusion process.} Established some quantitative bounds on the distribution of a statistic of an interacting particle system similar to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. 
  \item {\it Fringe pairs in generalized MSTD sets.} Led a project to find new ways to construct generalized MSTD sets, which are special finite sets of integers, and found the most ``extreme'' classical MSTD set known at the time using our new methods.
